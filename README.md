# Handwritten Digit Recognition
A handwritten digit detection and recognition system using CNN, coupled with a Flask application where users can draw digits and instantly see the prediction.

The project involves preprocessing the MNIST dataset, adding random noise for robust testing, and training a CNN model for both digit classification and localization. 
In addition to implementing bounding box generation to locate the digits within the input images. 

The model was trained on both original and noisy data, achieving strong performance.


Key tools and libraries used:
* TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the CNN
* NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing 
* Matplotlib for visualizing predictions and bounding boxes
* Google Colab: Used as the primary development environment to train and evaluate the CNN model, benefiting from free cloud-based GPUs for faster computation and easy collaboration.
* Flask for creating the web application interface
